## Welcome to my React Calculator!

This is a single page app that I built using [this](https://blog.usejournal.com/everything-react-first-app-188b33a880ca) tutorial as a guide.

## Purpose

I decided to work on this app as a learning tool to get more familiar with building snappy react applications and focus on a clean, modern and interactive UI.

## Technologies and Libraries

These are the primary tools I used to create the app:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/)
